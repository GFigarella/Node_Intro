# Node_Intro / LIRI Homework

In this assigment, I will make an interpretation program akin to SIRI, but instead of voice-interpretation, it will be 'language'-interpretation. For this assignment, I will be using the Twitter, Spotify and OMDB APIs.

The user will enter some specific commands in the command line, and depending on the command entered, a different API will run.
